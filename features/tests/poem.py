poem = "Whose woods these are I think I know.\n\
His house is in the village though;\n\
He will not see me stopping here\n\
To watch his woods fill up with snow.\n\
\n\
My little horse must think it queer\n\
To stop without a farmhouse near\n\
Between the woods and frozen lake\n\
The darkest evening of the year.\n\
\n\
He gives his harness bells a shake\n\
To ask if there is some mistake.\n\
The only other sound's the sweep\n\
Of easy wind and downy flake.\n\
\n\
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,\n\
But I have promises to keep,\n\
And miles to go before I sleep,\n\
And miles to go before I sleep."
